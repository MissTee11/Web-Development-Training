Assignment3 Tasks:
JavaScript Introduction:

Write a brief comment at the top of your JavaScript file explaining what JavaScript is and how it works in the browser.

Syntax and Basics:

Variables: Declare variables using var, let, and const. Show examples of declaring and assigning values to each type of variable.

Data Types: Create variables of different data types (Number, String, Boolean, Object, Array, Null, Undefined, Symbol) and log their values and types to the console.

Operators: Perform arithmetic operations, comparisons, and use logical operators. Show examples of each and log the results to the console.

Expressions and Statements: Write a few expressions and statements, and describe the difference between them.

Control Flow:

Conditional Statements: Write a function that takes a number as input and uses if, else if, and else statements to classify the number as 'positive', 'negative', or 'zero'.

Loops: Write a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 10, a while loop to print the numbers from 10 to 1, and a do-while loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.

Error Handling: Write a function that takes two numbers and divides them. Use try, catch, and finally to handle any potential errors (e.g., division by zero).

Functions:

Function Declaration: Write a function that takes two arguments (a name and age) and returns a greeting message.

Function Expression: Create an anonymous function that calculates the factorial of a number and invoke it.

Arrow Function: Write an arrow function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array with each number squared.
